_The Waterfall_ by Henri Rousseau, 1910

# Fountaindale Class

This directory contains code used for a introductory Python course I am teaching at the library. The exercises are intended to "kick-off" 
someone's coding journey, not provide a comprehensive overview or even a foundational understanding of computer science principles. I'll leave
that to the learner. 

Also, I'm definitely not the person who should be teaching computer science concepts. You wouldn't learn to fly a plane from an inexperienced
pilot, would you?

It begins with a "Hello world!" program (as is tradition) and ends with a basic transposition cipher, all in Python. I also cover some basic 
cryptography terms just for the sake of whimsy, because what is more fun than cryptography? Nothing. (Maybe basketball.) 

- Exercise 1: Hello world
    - first function, defining variables, tripping errors

- Exercise 2: Arithmetic stuff? Variable types?
    - variable types, type() function, operators, standard functions

- Exercise 3: Conditional statements
    - if-else, while, input() function, type conversion

- Exercise 4: Defining functions
    - user-defined functions, calling functions, flow control
    - with some jazz: importing modules, calling functions from imported modules, if __name__ == '__main__'

- Exercise 5: Lists
    - arrays, indexing, type conversions

- Exercise 6: Transposition cipher
    - cryptography concepts, for and while loops, passing variables to functions

- Exercise 7: Hashing passwords
    - culmination project, real application, bytes() function
